# From Explanation to Detection: Multimodal Insights into Disagreement in Misogynous Memes

This repository contains the code developed for "From Explanation to Detection: Multimodal Insights into Disagreement in Misogynous Memes". It contains several scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper. 
The scripts allow both to estimate the Element Disagreement Scores (EDS) for each constituent in the training dataset, and to estimate Sentence Disagreement Scores (EDS) according to the four proposed strategies: Sum, Mean, Median, and Minimum.

### Dataset Request Form
The datasets are exclusively reserved for the participants of SemEval-2022 Task 5 and are not to be used freely. The data may be distributed upon request and for academic purposes only. To request the datasets, please fill out the following form: https://forms.gle/AGWMiGicBHiQx4q98
After submitting the required info, participants will have a link to a folder containing the datasets in a zip format (trial, training and development) and the password to uncompress the files.

Data provided by the challenge have been enriched with a synthetic dataset. More information about the synthetic dataset creation can be found in the [paper](InProgress),
while information for download it can be found [here](https://github.com/MIND-Lab/SemEval2022-Task-5-Multimedia-Automatic-Misogyny-Identification-MAMI-).
